<h2>Hi, I'm Lily! 👋</h2>

I'm an 11th grade student attending high school at Harbord Collegiate Institute in Toronto, Canada. I'm interested in pretty much anything coding and computer science related.
  
I do a lot of web development, frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) and backend (Python, Flask). Currently looking at game development and machine learning :D
