<h2>Hi, I'm Lily! 👋</h2>

I'm a 12th grade student attending high school in Toronto, Canada. I'm interested in pretty much anything coding and computer science related.
  
I do web development, frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) and backend (Python, Flask). I try a bit of competative programming with Java/Python/C++ (idrk I kinda suck -> <a href="https://dmoj.ca/user/LilyMeng">DMOJ</a>). I attend hackathons for fun whenever and currently learning machine learning and game development!
