<h2>Hi, I'm Lily! ðŸ‘‹</h2>

I'm a 12th grade student attending high school in Toronto, Canada. I'm interested in pretty much anything coding and computer science related.
  
I do web development, frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) and backend (Python, Flask). I try a bit of competative programming with Java/Python/C++ (idrk I kinda suck -> <a href="https://dmoj.ca/user/LilyMeng">DMOJ</a>). I attend hackathons for fun whenever and currently aiming to learn game development and machine learning, starting off with <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/thirty-days-of-ml">Kaggle's 30 days of ML</a>.

<h2>Additional Information</h2>
<p>You can find my LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lilyxmeng">here</a> and other platforms I use <a href="https://linktr.ee/LilyxMeng">here</a>. Feel free to connect with me!</p>
<p>I'm also hoping to get a personal website set up soon âœ¨ I'm looking forward to sharing my experiences!</p>
